// Task: Implement recursive dividend date prediction functionality.

1. **Component Behavior:**
   - **Input:** `dividendData` received as a prop. It is an array of dividend objects (e.g., `{date: "2024-01-15", amount: 2.5}`).
   - **Enhancement:**
     - Append a new field `timeline` to each object in `dividendData`:
       - If the date is the most recent, set `timeline: "most recent"`.
       - For all predicted dates, set `timeline: "predicted"`.
   - **Trigger:** When the "Add to Bundle" button is clicked:
     - Send the current `dividendData` JSON to the server action.

2. **Server Action:**
   - **Input:** JSON data of `dividendData` received from the component.
   - **Processing:**
     - Use OpenAI to analyze the provided data and predict the next dividend date.
     - Append the new predicted dividend object (e.g., `{date: "2024-04-15", amount: 2.6, timeline: "predicted"}`) to the JSON.
   - **Output:** Return the updated JSON with the new predicted date included.

3. **Component Update:**
   - Replace the current `dividendData` with the updated JSON returned from the server.
   - Ensure this works recursively, allowing subsequent predictions based on the most recent data, including previously predicted dates.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - Handle asynchronous operations seamlessly (e.g., API requests and updates).
   - Ensure data integrity, avoiding duplication of predicted dates.

5. **Code Implementation:**
   - Write modular and reusable functions for:
     - Updating the `timeline` field in the component.
     - Fetching and processing data in the server action.
   - Use a React state for `dividendData` to reflect changes dynamically.
   - Optimize the OpenAI API call to minimize latency.

**Deliverables:**
- Frontend component logic (React/JSX).
- Backend server action code for OpenAI integration and JSON processing.
- Recursively functioning dividend timeline prediction system.
